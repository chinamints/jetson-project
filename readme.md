# Bird Watcher

This project is a bird detection program that notifies the user of the presence of birds. Typically, birdwatchers or animal photographers may have to wait for hours to get their first sighting. With this program, they can be alerted of the presence of birds in real time while they are completing other tasks.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm for this code works by using DetectNet, an object detection model. It is able to detect multiple objects.

The code starts by importing the necessary tools from jetson libraries. It then prepares to open the camera and create a file for the recorded video. The camera then gets opened and starts detecting the scene for birds. If the code detects a bird in the view of the camera, it alerts the user of said bird.
